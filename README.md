This replication package observes major cities within the United States and different aspects. Such as population, land locking, diversity percentages, crime data, and others. Here I sought to observe if Non-Hispanic White data affected crime average data and find relationship within. 

## **Instructions**
For the script, open the "nguyen.R" which has code and the dataset needed to be uploaded is raw_data.csv

## **Data**
The data that was collected for this was data of Non-Hispanic White populations of every major/more populated cities in the United States as well as the crime average within each city of about every 1000 people. All cities in this data were typically above 300k+ population and were very significant numbers for each data. 

## **Operationalization**
I went through the US Census and another website to observe each nhwhite population and a neighborhood website to calculated each crime average. 

The concept of nhwhite was operationalized by the percentages that were shown on the Census. Every Non-Hispanic White population was a very large diversity group that could be marginalized and made into significant numbers. 

The concept of crime average was based on population. Cities with larger populations and a higher rate of populaity/visits would most likely have a higher crime average. Overall, the idea of crime average can play with many factors such as state, diversity group, region, and average salary. Higher crime averages are more likely found in cities with larger populations, cities with lower gdp, and other factors.
